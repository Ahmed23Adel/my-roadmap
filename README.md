# Authentication & API Management
Built on three custom libraries for seamless auth handling:

* [AdelsonAuthManager](https://github.com/Ahmed23Adel/AdelsonAuthManager) - Handles signup, login, and token refresh with secure keychain storage  
* [AdelsonApiCaller](https://github.com/Ahmed23Adel/AdelsonApiCaller) - Automatically attaches tokens to requests, refreshes expired tokens, and re-authenticates when needed  
* [AdelsonValidator](https://github.com/Ahmed23Adel/AdelsonValidator) - Client-side validation for email format and password policies (easy/medium/hard), and any custom validation  

How It Works

1. Validate input with AdelsonValidator
2. Send request via AdelsonApiCaller
3. Handle auth automatically with AdelsonAuthManager
